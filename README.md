# Basic Onshape CAD
Engineering 4 assignments to learn Onshape, and build a caster.
## Base

### Reflection
In this assignment, I built a base for the caster which is composed of a rectangular plate with 6 small holes and 1 large one. It took a bit of time to get used to the shortcuts and buttons in Onshape, but I can see that when I get comfortable with it, it will be much easier to use than Solidworks.
## Mount

### Reflection
In this assignment, I built a mount for the caster which is a square plate with 4 small holes and 1 large hole. In the future, I might make two separate sketches for the holes and the plate so that I could delete one without messing up the other one.  For now, I've decided to make each piece of the caster its own part studio within one document, but I might start putting multiple parts in one part studio if that proves easier.
## Fork

### Reflection
In this assignment, I built the fork for the caster which will help attach the wheel to the base.  I learned how to do fillets, chamfers, and mirrors in Onshape, which are all very easy to use.
## Tire

### Reflection
In this assignment, I built a tire for the caster, which taught me how to use revolve and how to change color in Onshape.
