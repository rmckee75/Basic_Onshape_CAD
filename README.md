# Basic Onshape CAD
Engineering 4 assignments to learn Onshape, and build a caster.
## Base

### Reflection
In this assignment, I built a base for the caster which is composed of a rectangular plate with 6 small holes and 1 large one. It took a bit of time to get used to the shortcuts and buttons in Onshape, but I can see that when I get comfortable with it, it will be much easier to use than Solidworks.
